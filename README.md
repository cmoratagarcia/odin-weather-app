Practice what you've learned by creating a weather forecast site using the Visual Crossing API.

Requirements:

- Write functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location.
- Set up a form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info.
- Display the information on your webpage!
- Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API. Use DevTools to test for low-end devices.
